        <p>Dear {{ first_name }},</p>

        <p>This is an automated email from {{ coop_name }}.</p>

        <p>
            You were looking for a stand-in for the following shift: {{ shift_display_name }}.<br/>
            Another member has taken over your slot for that shift.
        </p>

        <p>If you haven't done so already, don't forget to attend another shift to compensate for the one you will miss!</p>
